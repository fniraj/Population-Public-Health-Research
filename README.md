# Quality and Cost of Care of Health Informatics in Healthcare Setting

## Transforming Healthcare Through Informatics: Better Care & Lower Costs

### Introduction
In the modern world, health informatics is a rapidly evolving field within medical sciences. Many treatment criteria for diseases are still suboptimal, complex, and costly, making them unaffordable for many people around the globe. Moreover, traditional treatment methods are time-consuming, with low success rates, especially in the later stages of diseases.

### Significance
Health informatics is an emerging discipline in medical science that not only improves treatment efficiency but also makes healthcare faster, more convenient, and more affordable. The integration of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** technologies can save billions of dollars each year globally. Furthermore, it enhances the interpretability, diagnosis, and prediction of disease outcomes through improved interoperability systems. The adoption of **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**, **Electronic Medical Records (EMR)**, and interoperable systems can significantly reduce disease management costs, eliminate clinical malpractice, and improve healthcare delivery.

### Problems to be Solved
Health informatics technology helps reduce healthcare costs, hospital workloads, and patient waiting times. Technologies such as **Remote Patient Monitoring**, **Telemedicine**, and **Wearable Devices** allow for remote diagnosis and treatment, resulting in reduced treatment costs and enhanced treatment quality compared to traditional methods.

### Specialization
I am a health informatics and medical professional with expertise in:
- **E.H.R** & **E.M.R** systems
- **Python**, **MySQL**, **Linux/Ubuntu**
- **Pharmacology**, **Ophthalmology**, **Molecular Biology**, and **Animal Studies**

This unique combination of clinical expertise and health informatics knowledge enables me to predict disease progression, avert diseases at early stages, and improve patient care. My understanding of AI, ML, and DL further helps in transforming healthcare into a more efficient, affordable, and effective system for patients and providers.

### Personal Contribution
As a clinician (Optometrist & Pharmacologist), I use health informatics technologies to diagnose and treat diseases at early stages. This not only allows for early intervention but also helps prevent the progression of diseases by understanding their patterns, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
